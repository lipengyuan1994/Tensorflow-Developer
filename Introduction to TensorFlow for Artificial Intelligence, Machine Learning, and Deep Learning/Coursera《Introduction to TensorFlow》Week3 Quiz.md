  A. 25x25
 B. 31x31
 C. 28x28

## Q6

6. Applying Convolutions on top of our Deep neural network will make training:

  ***A. It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!***
 B. Faster
 C. Stay the same
 D. Slower
