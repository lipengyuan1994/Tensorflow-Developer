## Sequence bias

Sequence bias is when the order of things can impact the selection of things. For example, if I were to ask you your favorite TV show, and listed "Game of Thrones", "Killing Eve", "Travellers" and "Doctor Who" in that order, you're probably more likely to select 'Game of Thrones' as you are familiar with it, and it's the first thing you see. Even if it is equal to the other TV shows. So, when training data in a dataset, we don't want the sequence to impact the training in a similar way, so it's good to shuffle them up.
